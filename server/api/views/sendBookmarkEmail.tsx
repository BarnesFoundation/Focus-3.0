/** TODO - eventually figure out what templating engine

 * This will also apply for the story deliver email
 *
 * Hopefully, we can use React to build the template and convert it to static HTML
 * using the ReactDOM/Server.renderToStaticHTML method
 *
 * This can wait until we integrate the frontend since we'll have to add React as a dependency anyway
